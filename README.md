High blood sugar levels are a hallmark of diabetes, a long-term condition caused by
the body’s inability to produce or efficiently use insulin. Diabetes has been steadily
increasing worldwide, with an estimated 422 million adults in 2014 suffering from the
disease, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). By 2040, this number is
expected to reach 642 million, making diabetes a major issue for public health.
Diabetes has increased as a result of a number of factors, including population
growth, aging, urbanization, unhealthy diets, and inactivity. Obesity and metabolic
disorders, which are major risk factors for type 2 diabetes, have increased as a result of
these factors.

the world. In 2017, it was estimated by the International Diabetes Federation that 72.9
million adults in India had diabetes.

100,000 people, and mortality increased from 22.30 to 27.35 per 100,000 people.
